#STUDENTS PERFOMANCE RESULTS



##Project Overview

This work is focused on examining the students perfomance in a school and providing necessary insights 
about the data for any adjustments in the work.


##Data Sources

I used a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle Datasets(Students Pefomance)


##Tools Used

Excel - Data Cleaning
        Data Analysis
        Data Visualization


##Data Cleaning/Prepation

In the Data preparation phase I perfomed the following;
     -Replace some null values
     -Sort all the columns in ascending order
     -Organize some columns using the [IF] statement
     -Remove all the duplicates
     -Fix some columns to curver all the details
     -Add column headings


##Exploratory Data Analysis 

-What the perfomances looked like per group
-Compared the performances of both Females and Males in different levels of Education i.e Secondary and Universities
-Evaluated the perfomances of both female and male students witha focus on thier ethnic groups


##Results/Findings

-Due to some unknown reasons Lower levels of education tends to perfome better than higher levels
Ethic group and the origins of the students tends to create some differences in their perfomances as others perfomence very well compared to the rest.
