##Data cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation test I did the following tasks;

.Handling missing values
.Data cleaning i.e removing duplicates and Data formatting


##Exploratory Data Analysis

Here are some of the questions I tried answering
-How does weather affect bike usage?
-Total bike rides between specific periods?
-What's the two week moving average?(7-day/30-day moving average?)
-Tried to make my Visuals dynamic and more user friendly by applying things like filters


##Results/Findings

-Bike rides in the duration has not been consistent due to increase and decreases in the numbers
-Bad weather changes has negatively affected the competion in a way that more number only happen at favorable seasons


##Recommendations
-More should be invested to bring more competitors to join the competition
-The sports organizers should consider weather changes so the interruption caused by weather at 
  times the sports are on be avoided
